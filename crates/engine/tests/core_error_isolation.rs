//! `CoreError` content-isolation regression test (whitepaper §5.3 / gap
//! register #20).
//!
//! `marque-core::CoreError` has two variants that *could* carry input
//! bytes verbatim through their `Display` impl:
//!
//! - `MalformedMarking(String)` — Display interpolates the embedded
//!   string via `{0:?}`.
//! - `UnrecognizedToken { token: String, offset: usize }` — Display
//!   interpolates the embedded token via `{token:?}`.
//!
//! Today the parser source actually constructs only the first of these,
//! and only on inputs the scanner does not produce (portion candidates
//! without balanced parens, or empty inner content). `UnrecognizedToken`
//! is unreferenced. The third variant — `InvalidUtf8(Span)` — carries
//! no embedded content. Even so, the leak surface is a *contract*, not
//! a state of the source: a future change that adds a content-bearing
//! `MalformedMarking` site, or that revives `UnrecognizedToken`, would
//! re-open the channel.
//!
//! `StrictRecognizer` (`crates/engine/src/recognizer.rs:97`) catches
//! `CoreError` from `Parser::parse` and discards it — `Err(_) =>
//! Parsed::Ambiguous { candidates: Vec::new() }`. The engine never sees
//! the error value. `LintResult` carries no error channel; `FixResult`
//! carries `RemainingDiagnostic` and `AppliedFix` whose text fields are
//! built from token canonicals, not error-Display output.
//!
//! Whitepaper §5.3 calls the no-leak property out as a *convention* —
//! the type system permits a future caller to call `.to_string()` on a
//! `CoreError` and route it into an audit record or server response.
//! This file is the runtime backstop: a canary embedded inside
//! adversarial input bytes does not appear in any serialized output the
//! engine produces.
//!
//! ## What this test does NOT prove
//!
//! - It does not prove that no future code path will surface
//!   `CoreError`. Nothing short of making `CoreError` `pub(crate)`
//!   (a breaking change to the existing `marque_core::CoreError`
//!   re-export) prevents that at the type level.
//! - It does not enumerate every `CoreError` variant. `UnrecognizedToken`
//!   has no construction site to exercise; `InvalidUtf8` carries no
//!   content. The cases below cover the one variant that has a
//!   reachable construction site (`InvalidUtf8`, via a portion span
//!   with invalid UTF-8) plus three adversarial inputs that ride the
//!   recognizer/engine path past the strict grammar.
//!
//! What this test does prove:
//!
//! 1. The current `StrictRecognizer::recognize` discards `Err(CoreError::*)`
//!    from `Parser::parse` rather than surfacing the error value. A
//!    regression that started routing `CoreError::Display` into a
//!    `Diagnostic.message` or an `AppliedFix.proposal.{original,replacement}`
//!    field would be caught here.
//! 2. The canary infrastructure is real — the self-test asserts that
//!    `CoreError::MalformedMarking(canary).to_string()` does carry the
//!    canary, so a future Display redaction surfaces explicitly rather
//!    than silently obsoleting the rest of this file.

/// Of the four `CoreError` construction sites in
/// `crates/core/src/parser.rs`, only `InvalidUtf8(span)` is reliably
/// reachable from scanner-fed input today (`MalformedMarking` with a
/// content-bearing payload requires either a portion candidate
/// without balanced parens — which the scanner does not produce — or
/// an empty inner string after stripping parens, which carries no
/// content; `UnrecognizedToken` is unreferenced by the parser source).
/// `InvalidUtf8` carries only a `Span`, no content, so a Display leak
/// of that variant would not expose input bytes.
///
/// The cases below therefore split into two roles:
///
/// 1. **Guaranteed `Parser::parse` -> `Err(CoreError::*)` site.** The
///    UTF-8-corrupted portion `(0xff)` survives the scanner, reaches
///    the recognizer's `parser.parse(...)` call, and returns
///    `Err(CoreError::InvalidUtf8(span))`. `StrictRecognizer`
///    (`crates/engine/src/recognizer.rs:97`) discards the error via
///    `Err(_) => Parsed::Ambiguous { candidates: Vec::new() }`. This
///    case proves the discard path holds — a future refactor that
///    Display'd the error into the recognizer output would surface
///    the (variant-specific) error string in the lint stream and
///    fail the assertions below.
/// 2. **Adversarial recognizer/engine inputs.** The remaining cases
///    interleave the canary with real marking delimiters so the
///    scanner produces candidates, the recognizer returns
///    `Parsed::Ambiguous`, and the engine drops them. They prove that
///    no engine code path interpolates input bytes into a public
///    output field independently of `CoreError`.
///
/// The test does NOT claim every `CoreError` variant is constructed.
/// It claims that the engine, fed input designed to exercise the
/// `Parser::parse -> Err(CoreError)` path that does exist today,
/// surfaces no canary in any text-bearing public output.
